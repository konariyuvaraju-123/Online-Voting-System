# Online Voting System

An online voting system tailored for college elections, built using Node.js and Express. This system allows students to participate in college elections with a secure and straightforward interface.

## Project Structure
- **`app.js`**: Main server file for setting up routes and configuring the server.
- **`views/`**: Contains frontend static files, including `index.html` for the user interface.
- **`node_modules/`**: Houses project dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Ensures only authenticated users (students) can participate in the voting process.
- **Secure Voting Process**: Each user can vote only once, with secure backend handling of votes.
- **College Election Focus**: Designed specifically for college election scenarios.

## Planned Enhancements
These additional features are under consideration to enhance functionality and simulate a complete voting system:

1. **Vote Count Feature**  
   - **Backend Vote Tallying**: Count votes for each candidate in real-time and store them in a database.
   - **Database Management**: Separate storage for candidates and their respective vote counts.
   - **Live Updates**: Integrate Socket.io or similar for real-time updates to the vote count display.

2. **Result Display**
   - **Vote Calculation**: A backend function to determine the winning candidate once voting ends.
   - **Result Page**: Frontend page displaying the winner and total votes.

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - **Election Control**: An admin feature to initiate and end elections, reset votes, and oversee results.
   - **Result Viewing**: Live results viewable by the admin during and after the voting period.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (views/index.html)
